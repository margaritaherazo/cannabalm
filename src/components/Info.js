          <p>
            Cannabalm is a soothing balm made from natural cannabis extracts.
            It's great for relieving muscle pain, reducing inflammation, and promoting relaxation.

            Use it on sore muscles, joints, or anywhere you feel tension. It's non-psychoactive,
            gentle on skin, and made with love.
